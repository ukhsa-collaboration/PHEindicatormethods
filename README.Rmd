# PHEindicatormethods

This is an R package to support analysts in the execution of statistical methods approved for use in the production of PHE indicators such as those presented via [Fingertips](https://fingertips.phe.org.uk/).  It provides functions for the generation of Proportions, Rates, DSRs, ISRs, Means, Life Expectancy and Slope Index of Inequality including confidence intervals for these statistics, and a function for assigning data to quantiles.  

In October 2021 Public Health England (PHE) was disbanded and as a result this package is now owned by the Department of Health and Social Care.  It will continue to be supported and to prevent breaking changes there are currently no immediate plans to rename the package or its functions in light of this organisational change.

Any feedback would be appreciated and can be provided using the Issues section of the [PHEindicatormethods GitHub repository](https://github.com/ukhsa-collaboration/PHEindicatormethods).

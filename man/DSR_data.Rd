\description{
A numeric vector containing nineteen 5-year age band populations making up the 2013 European Standard Population
ordered from age 0-4, 5-9, 10-14 ... to ...  85-89, 90+.  Sorted by increasing age band.
}
\section{Notes}{
 The 2013 European Standard Population is modelled and published by Eurostat [1] for use in the production of
age-standardised rates.  It uses the unweighted average 2010-based population projections of the European Union (x27)
and European Free Trade Association (x4) countries for the period 2011-2030 broken down into 5-year age bands from
age 0 - age 95+ with the 0-5 age band separated into age 0 and age 1-4.  The version provided with this package combines
the age 0 and age 1-4 populations into a single 0-4 age band and combines the 90-94 and 95+ populations into a single 90+ age band,
giving 19 age bands in total.
